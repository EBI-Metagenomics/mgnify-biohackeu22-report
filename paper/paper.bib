  abstract = "MGnify (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) provides a free to use
              platform for the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome
              data derived from sequencing microbial populations that are
              present in particular environments. Over the past 2 years, MGnify
              (formerly EBI Metagenomics) has more than doubled the number of
              publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource.
              Recently, an updated approach to data analysis has been unveiled
              (version 5.0), replacing the previous single pipeline with
              multiple analysis pipelines that are tailored according to the
              input data, and that are formally described using the Common
              Workflow Language, enabling greater provenance, reusability, and
              reproducibility. MGnify's new analysis pipelines offer additional
              approaches for taxonomic assertions based on ribosomal internal
              transcribed spacer regions (ITS1/2) and expanded protein
              functional annotations. Biochemical pathways and systems
              predictions have also been added for assembled contigs. MGnify's
              growing focus on the assembly of metagenomic data has also seen
              the number of datasets it has assembled and analysed increase
              six-fold. The non-redundant protein database constructed from the
              proteins encoded by these assemblies now exceeds 1 billion
              sequences. Meanwhile, a newly developed contig viewer provides
              fine-grained visualisation of the assembled contigs and their
              enriched annotations.",

A thriving global community continues to use, maintain and contribute to the project, with support from multiple national infrastructure providers that enable freely accessible analysis and training services. The Galaxy Training Network supports free, self-directed, virtual training with \\&gt;230 integrated tutorials. Project engagement metrics have continued to grow over the last 2Â years, including source code contributions, publications, software packages wrapped as tools, registered users and their daily analysis jobs, and new independent specialized servers. Key Galaxy technical developments include an improved user interface for launching large-scale analyses with many files, interactive tools for exploratory data analysis, and a complete suite of machine learning tools. Important scientific developments enabled by Galaxy include Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP) assembly workflows and global SARS-CoV-2 collaborations.}",

    abstract = "{The InterPro database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) provides an integrative classification of protein sequences into families, and identifies functionally important domains and conserved sites. InterProScan is the underlying software that allows protein and nucleic acid sequences to be searched against InterPro's signatures. Signatures are predictive models which describe protein families, domains or sites, and are provided by multiple databases. InterPro combines signatures representing equivalent families, domains or sites, and provides additional information such as descriptions, literature references and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to produce a comprehensive resource for protein classification. Founded in 1999, InterPro has become one of the most widely used resources for protein family annotation. Here, we report the status of InterPro (version 81.0) in its 20th year of operation, and its associated software, including updates to database content, the release of a new website and REST API, and performance improvements in InterProScan.}",
