	Abstract = {The MGnify platform (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) facilitates the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome-derived nucleic acid sequences. The platform provides access to taxonomic assignments and functional annotations for nearly half a million analyses covering metabarcoding, metatranscriptomic, and metagenomic datasets, which are derived from a wide range of different environments. Over the past 3 years, MGnify has not only grown in terms of the number of datasets contained but also increased the breadth of analyses provided, such as the analysis of long-read sequences. The MGnify protein database now exceeds 2.4 billion non-redundant sequences predicted from metagenomic assemblies. This collection is now organised into a relational database making it possible to understand the genomic context of the protein through navigation back to the source assembly and sample metadata, marking a major improvement. To extend beyond the functional annotations already provided in MGnify, we have applied deep learning-based annotation methods. The technology underlying MGnify's Application Programming Interface (API) and website has been upgraded, and we have enabled the ability to perform downstream analysis of the MGnify data through the introduction of a coupled Jupyter Lab environment.},

    abstract = {There is an ongoing explosion of scientific datasets being generated, brought on by recent technological advances in many areas of the natural sciences. As a result, the life sciences have become increasingly computational in nature, and bioinformatics has taken on a central role in research studies. However, basic computational skills, data analysis, and stewardship are still rarely taught in life science educational programs, resulting in a skills gap in many of the researchers tasked with analysing these big datasets. In order to address this skills gap and empower researchers to perform their own data analyses, the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) has previously developed the Galaxy Training Platform (https://training.galaxyproject.org), an open access, community-driven framework for the collection of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) training materials for data analysis utilizing the user-friendly Galaxy framework as its primary data analysis platform. Since its inception, this training platform has thrived, with the number of tutorials and contributors growing rapidly, and the range of topics extending beyond life sciences to include topics such as climatology, cheminformatics, and machine learning. While initially aimed at supporting researchers directly, the GTN framework has proven to be an invaluable resource for educators as well. We have focused our efforts in recent years on adding increased support for this growing community of instructors. New features have been added to facilitate the use of the materials in a classroom setting, simplifying the contribution flow for new materials, and have added a set of train-the-trainer lessons. Here, we present the latest developments in the GTN project, aimed at facilitating the use of the Galaxy Training materials by educators, and its usage in different learning environments.},

              present in particular environments. Over the past 2 years, MGnify
              (formerly EBI Metagenomics) has more than doubled the number of
              publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource.
              Recently, an updated approach to data analysis has been unveiled
              (version 5.0), replacing the previous single pipeline with
              multiple analysis pipelines that are tailored according to the
              input data, and that are formally described using the Common
              Workflow Language, enabling greater provenance, reusability, and
              reproducibility. MGnify's new analysis pipelines offer additional
              approaches for taxonomic assertions based on ribosomal internal
              transcribed spacer regions (ITS1/2) and expanded protein
              functional annotations. Biochemical pathways and systems
              predictions have also been added for assembled contigs. MGnify's
              growing focus on the assembly of metagenomic data has also seen
              the number of datasets it has assembled and analysed increase
              six-fold. The non-redundant protein database constructed from the
              proteins encoded by these assemblies now exceeds 1 billion
              sequences. Meanwhile, a newly developed contig viewer provides
              fine-grained visualisation of the assembled contigs and their

Signatures are predictive models which describe protein families, domains or sites, and are provided by multiple databases. InterPro combines signatures representing equivalent families, domains or sites, and provides additional information such as descriptions, literature references and Gene Ontology (GO) terms, to produce a comprehensive resource for protein classification. Founded in 1999, InterPro has become one of the most widely used resources for protein family annotation.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has the potential to open insight into the structure of proteins at the scale of evolution. It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a break-through in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-of-the-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metage-nomic Atlas. This is the first large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high confidence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
